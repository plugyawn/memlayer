# Track 3 LocoProp / Newton-Muon Experiments - 2026-05-31

Context:
- Track: `records/track_3_optimization`, 1x H100, 20 FineWeb chunks.
- Runner: `tools/run_track3_newton_muon.sh`.
- Base script: official `20260505_newton_muon/train_gpt_simple_newton_muon.py`.
- Torch: `2.11`.
- cuDNN SDPA disabled in generated script after Modal/Torch 2.11 cuDNN frontend plan failures.

## Active Reference

`track3-nm-3000-h100-20260531-r3`

- Mode: `TRACK3_NM_MODE=inverse`.
- App: `ap-70FfWdH8GjpnM5Dcfwop0Q`.
- Log: `.opencode/modal_track3_nm_3000_h100_20260531_r3.launch.log`.
- Status when this ledger was first written: active at step 1000+.

Observed validation:

| Step | Val loss |
| ---: | ---: |
| 125 | 4.66220 |
| 250 | 4.11564 |
| 375 | 3.92664 |
| 500 | 3.82270 |
| 625 | 3.75188 |
| 750 | 3.70750 |
| 875 | 3.66553 |
| 1000 | 3.62499 |

## Finite-Step LocoProp Filter

`track3-nm-finite-t2-3000-h100-20260531`

- Mode: `TRACK3_NM_MODE=finite`.
- Filter: continuous-time finite LocoProp response, `t=2.0`, `clip=4.0`.
- App: `ap-zU1ZoGI5FdNyAN6vD83BbF`.
- Stopped early after step 625 screen because it was consistently behind inverse.
- Log: `.opencode/modal_track3_nm_finite_t2_3000_h100_20260531.launch.log`.

Observed validation:

| Step | Val loss | Delta vs inverse at same step |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 125 | 4.66793 | +0.00573 |
| 250 | 4.11702 | +0.00138 |
| 375 | 3.93199 | +0.00535 |
| 500 | 3.82562 | +0.00292 |
| 625 | 3.75684 | +0.00496 |

Read: finite `t=2` did not improve on exact inverse. It stayed near the reference, so the implementation is not obviously broken, but it is not the better Track 3 lever at this setting.

## Additive LocoProp Correction

`track3-nm-additive-t2-a005-3000-h100-20260531`

- Mode: `TRACK3_NM_MODE=additive`.
- Filter: same finite response, `t=2.0`, `clip=4.0`.
- Separate correction alpha: `0.05`.
- App: `ap-au8YjkfAxboXTxJY5ZlgYW`.
- Stopped after first validation screen.
- Log: `.opencode/modal_track3_nm_additive_t2_a005_3000_h100_20260531.launch.log`.

Observed validation:

| Step | Val loss | Delta vs inverse |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 125 | 4.71964 | +0.05744 |

`track3-nm-additive-t2-a0005-3000-h100-20260531`

- Mode: `TRACK3_NM_MODE=additive`.
- Filter: same finite response, `t=2.0`, `clip=4.0`.
- Separate correction alpha: `0.005`.
- App: `ap-xpENbmQD3Lzr3R7JqRmtlV`.
- Stopped after first validation screen.
- Log: `.opencode/modal_track3_nm_additive_t2_a0005_3000_h100_20260531.launch.log`.

Observed validation:

| Step | Val loss | Delta vs inverse |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 125 | 4.68139 | +0.01919 |

Read: additive local displacement on top of Muon/NM state was harmful at both tested scales. Alpha `0.005` was less destructive than `0.05`, but still too far behind to justify continuing.
